Logical operators take boolean operands and return a boolean result. There are few important logical operators to remember. The operator `!`, is the logical not operator, which turns `true` values to `false` and `false` values to `true`. 

The `&&` operator is the logical and operator, which takes in two boolean values and returns true only if both of the values are true or false. The four different cases are shown below:

1. true && true - evaluates to true
2. true && false - evaluates to false
3. false && true - evaluates to false
4. false && false - evaluates to false

The `||` operator is the logical or operator, which takes in two boolean values and returns true if one of the values are true. The four different cases are shown below:

1. true || true - evaluates to true
2. true || false - evaluates to true
3. false || true - evaluates to true
4. false || false - evaluates to false

As JavaScript is a weakly typed language, any value can turn into true or false values. Every data type can be converted to it's boolean representation using double not (`!!`).
